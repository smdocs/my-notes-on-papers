# Steps to prove a problem X is NP Complete

> General Idea: In order to prove that a problem is NP complete,we need to show that ot is noth in NP and at least as <b>hard</b> as any other 
problem in NP.

### [Step 1: Show that problem X is in NP]()
### [Step 2: Pick a know NP complte problem]()
### [Step 3: Construct an algorithm to solve Y given an algorithm to solve X]()
### [Step 4: Prove the correctness of the algorithm to solve Y]()
### [Step 5: Deduce running time and wrap up.]()
