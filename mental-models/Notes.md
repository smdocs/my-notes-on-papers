#[Useful Mental Models](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d#.1z3ubjhso)

Mental models are useful to try to make sense of things and to help generate ideas. To actually be useful, however, you have to
apply them in the right context at the right time. And for that to happen naturally, you have to know them well and practice 
using them.

A mental model is just a concept you can use to help try to explain things (e.g. Hanlon’s Razor — “never attribute to malice 
that which is adequately explained by carelessness.”). There are tens of thousands of mental models, and every discipline has 
their own set that you can learn through coursework, mentorship, or first-hand experience.

There is a much smaller set of concepts, however, that come up repeatedly in day-to-day decision making, problem solving, and truth seeking. 
As Munger says, “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly‑wise person.”

#### Explaining
- (1) Hanlon’s Razor — “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness.”
- (1) Occam’s Razor — “Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.”
- (1) Cognitive Biases — “Tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality or good judgments.” (See list of cognitive biases)
- (1) Arguing from First Principle — “A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption.”
- (1) Proximate vs Root Cause — “A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the ‘real’ reason something occurred.”

#### Modeling
Modeling
- (1) Systems Thinking — “By taking the overall system as well as its parts into account systems thinking is designed to avoid potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences.” (related: causal loop diagrams)
- (1) Scenario Analysis — “A process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes.”
- (1) Power-law — “A functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.” (related: Pareto distribution; Pareto principle — “for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.”)
- (1) Normal Distribution — “A very common continuous probability distribution…Physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes (such as measurement errors) often have distributions that are nearly normal.” (related: central limit theorem)
- (1) Sensitivity Analysis — “The study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs.”
- (1) Cost-benefit Analysis — “A systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives that satisfy transactions, activities or functional requirements for a business.” (related: net present value — “a measurement of the profitability of an undertaking that is calculated by subtracting the present values of cash outflows (including initial cost) from the present values of cash inflows over a period of time.”, discount rate)
- (3) Heavy-tailed Distribution — “Probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded.” (related: fat-tailed distribution; long tail — “the portion of the distribution having a large number of occurrences far from the “head” or central part of the distribution.”; black swan theory — “a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight.”)
- (3) Simulation — “The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.”
- (3) Pareto Efficiency — “A state of allocation of resources in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off…A Pareto improvement is defined to be a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off, given a certain initial allocation of goods among a set of individuals.”
